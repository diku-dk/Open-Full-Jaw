### Dataset's structure

The folders' structure for a patient is shown below. The input folder contains the inputs to our pipeline, and the output folder includes the final outputs of the pipeline. Note that both mandible and maxilla subfolders in the input and output folder have the same structures.

### Details of different data in this dataset
:warning: Please make sure to install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) on your system before cloning the repository.

The dataset includes:
1. Clinically validated segmented geometries and the resulting unprocessed dense surface meshes
   > - They are original dense meshes in STL file format.
   > - They can be imported into different mesh editing tools to be modified or re-meshed by the users.
2. The quality and adaptive volumetric meshes to be used in FE simulations
   > - They are simulation-ready models in MSH file format.
   > - They are adaptive, conformal volumetric meshes with shared nodes in the contacting interfaces.
   > - They can be imported into different FE frameworks to be used in various scenarios.
3. The quality and adaptive surface meshes to be used in FE simulations
   > - They are reduced adaptive surface meshes generated by the pipeline in STL file format.
   > - They can be used by users who prefer to work with reduced meshed with no shared nodes in the contacting interfaces.
4. The principal axes of every patient's teeth that provides great information for setting up different scenarios automatically
   > - They are saved in JSON file format.
   > - The JSON file includes the UNN of each tooth, teeth' principal axes, including the center of mass of the crown, and endpoints of the mesial, labial, and long axes.
5. The automatically generated FEM files for a tipping and a biting scenario
   > - They are saved in FEBio (.FEB) file format.
   > - All tipping simulations can be imported in FEBioStudio and be run using [FEBio](https://febio.org/) solver.
   > - NOTE: In this study, we use [PolyFEM](https://polyfem.github.io/) solver for running both the biting and tipping simulations. This is to avoid any required parameter tweaking for the Augmented Lagrangian method used in FEBio for solving contact problems. By using PolyFEM, we can benefit from the Incremental Potential Contact ([IPC](https://ipc-sim.github.io/ipc-toolkit/)) formulation that ensures valid, penetration-free meshes during the entire simulation, with no parameter tweaking process.
   


### Different mesh sizes
The below table compares the total number of elements (x10^3) of the surface meshes (triangles) and volumetric meshes (tetrahedra). The number of elements is significantly reduced in the adaptive output surface meshes compared to that of the dense input surface meshes.
