## Motivation
Developing accurate patient-specific computational models of the human jaw acquired from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is labor-intensive and non-trivial. In addition, it involves time-consuming unreproducible manual procedures. Hence, we share an open-access dataset of 17 patient-specific computational models of human jaws and the utilized pipeline for generating them.

## Content of the repository
This repository comprises **17 patient-specific computational models of human jaws (including the mandible, maxilla, their associated teeth, and PDL meshes, as well as teeth principal axes)** and the utilized **code** for generating them.


### 1. Dataset

![dataset_gallery_named](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30265621/172655083-a12f4842-aaa8-4a69-be95-2cfde6063008.png)

:warning: Please make sure to install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) on your system before cloning the repository.

The [dataset](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw/tree/main/dataset) includes:
1. [Clinically validated segmented geometries](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw/tree/main/images) in form of unprocessed dense surface meshes that can be imported to different meshing tools
2. The quality and adaptive volumetric meshes to be used directly in FE simulations
3. The reduced surface meshes with no undesired gaps/penetrations
4. The principal axes of every patient's teeth that provides great information for setting up different scenarios automatically
5. The automatically generated FEM files for tipping scenario and a biting scenario
  

### 2. Code for reproducibility of dataset

6. The python code utilized for generating the volumetric meshes and producing the simulation files is shared in this repository. A summary of the pipeline is illustrated as follows

## How to install

#### Setting up the conda environment and the required packages

The first step is to set up your conda environment for running the jupyter notebook as below: 
```python
conda create -n fulljaw
conda activate fulljaw
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
Next, install the following packages in the fulljaw environment:
```python
conda install igl
conda install jupyter
conda install meshio
conda install meshplot
conda install -c anaconda scikit-image
```
#### Other Dependencies
:bangbang: **You need to install [PyMesh](https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh) by cloning the repository and building it on your machine.**

:bangbang: **Note that our pipeline uses fTetWild as a backbone for volumetric mesh generation. Therefore, you need to install the [fTetWild](https://wildmeshing.github.io/ftetwild/) by cloning the repository and building it on your machine in a desired directory.**

## How to use
First, activate the environment, then run jupyter notebook: 
```python
conda activate fulljaw
jupyter notebook
```
Now you can open and run the [pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw/blob/main/src/Pipeline.ipynb), which is an interactive python code, shared in the "src" folder, for reproducing the models of this dataset or generating new models for your own input data.

:warning: Make sure to update the "path_ftetwild" variable in [pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/diku-dk/Open-Full-Jaw/blob/main/src/Pipeline.ipynb) with the path of fTetwild's binary file, e.g.,

path_ftetwild = '/your_desired_directory/fTetWild/build/FloatTetwild_bin'

#### Summery of params and their default values:
